# Witcher-3-Theme-for-Discord
 I used cosmicsalad's Dark Matter theme as a template to this CSS, with help from Kilanna (big thanks) in helping me fix portions of CSS I botched; I'm new to this, and CSS is a nightmare. The background is from Witcher 3, and belongs to CD Projekt RED.

To use this theme you need [__BetterDiscord__](https://betterdiscord.net/home/)
Custom icon images will be coming sometime hopefully by July
